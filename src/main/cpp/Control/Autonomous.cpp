/* example auto routine

sets the auto routine name and devices to be used.  In this case, it is named smapleAuto, and will
use the drivetrain and note mechanism:
frc2::CommandPtr AutoRoutine::sampleAuto(DriveSubsystem *drive, NoteMechanism *noteMechanism) {

	This tells the auto routine to complete all of the actions in order
    return frc2::SequentialCommandGroup(

		This will reset the gyro
        drive->ZeroOdometry({0_m, 0_m, 0_deg}),

            frc2::SequentialCommandGroup(

				This will have the bot immediately stop:
				frc2::InstantCommand([drive] { drive->Drive({});}),

				This will have the bot shoot a note, which takes around 0.5 seconds:
				noteMechanism->ShootNote()

				//This will set a function to be called
				frc2::ParallelRaceGroup(

					In this case, the function is to drive, which is determined by (forwards/backwards, left/right, rotation, and orientation base):
                    frc2::RunCommand([drive] { drive->Drive({0_fps, 0_fps, 0_deg_per_s, 0});}, {drive}),

					This line will have the robot pick up a note while driving:
                    frc2::RunCommand([noteMechanism] { noteMechanism->PickupNote();}, {noteMechanism}),

					//This line will have the robot wait for the amount of time specified.  Normally, 1 second is enough:
                    frc2::WaitCommand(1_s)
                ),

				frc2::ParallelRaceGroup(

					//this command will reset the gyro
					//Be sure to stop the robot before hand, using the instant command
					drive->ZeroOdometry({0_m, 0_m, 0_deg}),

                    frc2::WaitCommand(1_s)
